        Mathematics is the science of structure, order, and relation
        that has evolved from elemental practices of counting, measuring,
        and describing the shapes of objects. It deals with logical reasoning
        and quantitative calculation, and its development has really involved an increasing
        degree of idealization and abstraction of its subject matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the 17th century, mathematics has been an indispensable
        adjunct to the physical sciences and technology, and in more recent
        times it has assumed a similar role in the quantitative aspects of the life sciences.
